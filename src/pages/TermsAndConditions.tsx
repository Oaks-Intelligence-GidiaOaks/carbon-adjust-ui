            </h3>
            <p>
              Escrow-Tech allows third party sellers to list and sell their
              services on Carbon Adjust at carbon- adjust.com. In each such case
              this is indicated on the respective product detail page. While
              Escrow-Tech as a service provider helps facilitate transactions
              that are carried out on Carbon- Adjust, Escrow-Tech is neither the
              buyer nor the seller of the seller's items. Escrow-Tech provides a
              service for sellers and buyers to engage and complete
              transactions. Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion
              of a sale for these third-party products is solely between buyer
              and seller. Escrow-Tech is not a party to this contract nor

            <p>
              We will do our utmost to ensure that availability of the
              Escrow-Tech Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions
              will be error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet,
              this cannot be guaranteed. Also, your access to Escrow-Tech
              Services may also be occasionally suspended or restricted to allow
              for repairs, maintenance, or the introduction of new facilities or
              services. We will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of
              any such suspension or restriction. <br />
              <br />
              Escrow-Tech will not be responsible for (i) losses that were not
              caused by any breach on our part, or (ii) any business loss
              (including loss of profits, revenue, contracts, anticipated
              savings, data, goodwill or wasted expenditure), or (iii) any
              indirect or consequential losses that were not foreseeable to both
              you and us when you commenced using Carbon-Adjust. <br />
              <br />
              We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply
              with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or
              failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable
              control. This condition does not affect your legal right to have
              goods sent or services provided within a reasonable time or to
              receive a refund if goods or services ordered cannot be supplied
              within a reasonable time owing to a cause beyond our reasonable
              control. <br />

              Nothing in these conditions limits or excludes our responsibility
